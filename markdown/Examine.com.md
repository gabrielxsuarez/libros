Suplementos
===========

- Core: Have the best safety-efficacy profile. When used responsibly, they are the supplements most likely to help and not cause side effects.
- Primary: May provide substantial benefit, but only in the right context. A primary option is not for everyone, but if you read the entry and find that you meet the criteria, consider adding the supplement to your combo.
- Secondary: Have less evidence for their effects. They could work or be a waste of money. Keep them in mind, but think twice before adding them to your combo.
- Unproven: Are backed by tradition or by mechanistic, animal, epidemiological, or anecdotal evidence, but not yet by convincing human trials. At this point, they are not good candidates for your combo.
- Inadvisable: Are either potentially dangerous or simply ineffective, marketing claims notwithstanding. Do not add them to your combo. At best, they’ll be a waste of money; at worst, they can cause you harm.
